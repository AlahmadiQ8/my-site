          <p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Computer, belay that order. How long can two people talk about nothing? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Your shields were failing, sir. You enjoyed that. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns.</p>

          <p>I'll be sure to note that in my log. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? We have a saboteur aboard. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Not if I weaken first. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? This should be interesting. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Ensign Babyface! I am your worst nightmare! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. and attack the Romulans. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement.</p>
